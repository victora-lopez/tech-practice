Robofriends was my first React project which the focus to learn how to combine my knowledge of HTML,CSS, and JavaScript and build usable, useful components for webpages.

This project has a searchable list of robots through a searchbar, a scrollable section for the robots, and a loading page if there are any issues which the page. 

A JSON-formatted API was used to retrieve the list of robots for this project.
